# SideHustleNZ

This is my first 'real' application in UWP, with multiple screens and a bit more functionality than basic projects.

This is for a ficticious company SideHustleNZ that connects people looking for jobs done around home (employers) with people looking for side gigs (employees).

Built out of inspiration for a lack in the NZ scene for finding a steady side hustle!

Alongside this application is a lot of documentation, including:

mood boards, business proposal, user profiles, scenarios of use documentation, use case diagram, icon library, design mockups, hieratical diagrams, annotated diagrams.
